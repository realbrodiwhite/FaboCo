### Incident Classification System

#### Incident Severity Levels
1. Level 1: Minor Incident
   - Limited impact
   - Easily contained
   - Minimal operational disruption
   - Localized resolution
   - Examples:

     * Minor security alert
     * Isolated equipment malfunction

2. Level 2: Significant Incident
   - Broader operational impact
   - Requires coordinated response
   - Potential service interruption
   - Cross-functional involvement
   - Examples:
     * Data breach attempt
     * Partial system compromise
     * Localized safety incident
     * Moderate technology failure

3. Level 3: Critical Incident
   - Enterprise-wide impact
   - Immediate executive engagement
   - Potential long-term consequences
   - Comprehensive response required
   - Examples:
     * Major cybersecurity attack
     * Significant data loss
